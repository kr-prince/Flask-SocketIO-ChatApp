# Flask-SocketIO-ChatApp

## Description
Building a simple chat application for fun as part of learning more about python flask and socket-IO.

## Setup
1. Create a separate conda environment using the existing *environment.yml* file
2. Acivate the conda environment, clone the repo and cd into the directory
3. Run `python mainApp.py`. By default it is served on `0.0.0.0` and silent mode, else you can specify the parameters `--hostIp <some IP> --debug True`
